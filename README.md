# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary data frame of ride-sharing data by city type, and also to create a line graph to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type. 

 

## Results
### Describe key differences
- From the summary DataFrame, it is clearly shown that the total rides get larger as the size of the city gets larger. Number of rides was also connected to the number of drivers as it also shows a linear relationship between city sizes and total drivers & total rides.  Lastly, total fare also showed a similar relationship as mentioned above.
However, if we carefully observe the average Fare per Ride and average Fare per Driver, it shows the opposite relationship as rural city types had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
(55.5% of rural, 39.5% of sub-urban, 16.5% of urban for average fare per driver)
(34.7% of rural, 30.9% of sub-urban, and 24.5% of urban for average fare per ride)
- From the multiple-line chart, the total fare of urban cities had the highest fare followed by suburban and rural cities. (around 9 times higher than rural and 2.2 times higher than sub-urban)

## Summary
### Recommendations
- the area of rural cities had the highest average fare per ride, since this took only around 5% of total rides,  running a business in this area would not be helpful to bring up the profit as the fare in that area is pretty high. 
- The average fare per driver and per ride was the lowest in urban areas and this took almost 70% of total rides, this also suggests that running a business in this area would not be helpful to significantly bring up the profit since it does not give much money for PyBer. 
- Lastly, Suburban drivers were  only 16-17% of total drivers, but they had significantly high total fares which took almost 30% of total fares, which highly recommends for businesses to come up with more business plans to bring up various incentive bonuses to target drivers, ultimately aiming for profit.
